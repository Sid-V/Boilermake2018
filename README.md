# SnapCalendar
Our Boilermake2018 hackathon project

Team - Sidharth Venkatesh, Tarcan Gul, Aahan Aggarwal, Karl Gaertner, Tyler Ruth


Problem statement - There are many events/callouts on campus that display posters with information. As students, we quickly take a picture of the event and hope to remember to go for it. But most often, we forget.

Solution - Our app takes an image of a poster, does OCR (Optical character recognition) and parses through the text to find the title, date, venue, time of the event/callout. We use this information to add a calendar event using Google Calendar.

This repo contains the working prototype using Python files.
